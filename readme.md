# Blog Platform Backend

A backend server built using **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB with Mongoose**. This API handles user authentication, role-based access control, blog CRUD operations, and provides a public API with advanced features like search, sort, and filter functionalities. The application also includes comprehensive error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

## üìã Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - **Admin**: Can manage users and blogs.
  - **Users**: Can manage their own blogs.
- **Secure Authentication**: Supports login and registration with role differentiation.
- **Password Security**: Uses **bcrypt** to securely hash and store user passwords.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Utilizes **JWT** to authenticate users before performing CRUD operations.
- **Validation**: Leverages **Zod** for robust schema validation.
- **Public Blog API**: Allows anyone to view blogs with search, sorting, and filtering.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses for consistent debugging and user feedback.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>=14.x.x)
- **MongoDB** (local or hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git**
- **TypeScript** (Optional: If you prefer to install globally)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayan-akd/b4-assignment-3-blog-project.git
   cd blog-platform-backend
    ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection URI:

   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=<development | production>
   PORT=<your_port_number>
   DATABASE_URL=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   DEFAULT_PASS=<your_default_password>
   BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=<your_bcrypt_salt_rounds>
   JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<your_jwt_access_secret>
   JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=<access_token_expiry_time>
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The server will run at http://localhost:5000 (or another port if you configure it differently).

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

The project includes several npm scripts for development and production:

- `npm run start`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `npm run start:dev`: Starts the application in development mode with live reloading using `ts-node-dev`.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run dev`: Watches for changes and compiles TypeScript files automatically.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using **ESLint**.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting errors.
- `npm run format`: Formats the codebase using **Prettier**.
- `npm run format:fix`: Automatically fixes formatting issues with **Prettier**.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Log in an existing user and get a JWT token.

### Blog Management
- **POST /api/blogs**: Create a new blog (requires authentication).
- **PATCH /api/blogs/:id**: Update a blog by its ID (requires authentication).
- **DELETE /api/blogs/:id**: Delete a blog by its ID (requires authentication).
- **GET /api/blogs**: Get all blogs with search, sort, and filter functionalities.

### Admin Actions
- **PATCH /api/admin/users/:userId/block**: Block a user by updating the `isBlocked` property (requires admin privileges).
